## Question

Barbara Has Boxes In Three Sizes: Large, Standard, And Small. She Puts 11 Large Boxes On A Table. She Leaves Some Of These Boxes Empty, And In All The Other Boxes She Puts 8 Standard Boxes. She Leaves Some Of These Standard Boxes Empty, And In All The Other Standard Boxes She Puts 8 (empty) Small Boxes. Now, 102 Of All The Boxes On The Table Are Empty. How Many Boxes Has Barbara Used In Total?

## Answer

11 large boxes on a table; some empty

8 standard boxes inside all other (large?) boxes

(8 + 1) * (total large boxes - some of the empty boxes on the table)

some standard boxes stay empty

in all other standard boxes, put 8 empty small boxes

(8 + 1) * (all other standard boxes - standard boxes that stay empty)

102 of all boxes on the table are empty (total boxes - 102 empty boxes = used boxes)

total boxes - 102 empty boxes = ((8 + 1) * (total large boxes - some of the empty boxes on the table)) + ((8 + 1) * (all other standard boxes - standard boxes that stay empty))
